**Description:

This Pong-Game is a classic implementation of the popular Ping-Pong game that we play in mobile phones. This game is entirely created using basic python concepts such as OOP's, datatypes, control flows and very useful modules such as the turtle module, random module and the time module. The objective of the game is to hit the yellow ball and 


**Gameplay:
 
This game is built with a perfect user interface where you can control the movement of the paddle using your keybord keys: player1: w: move up, s: move down, player2: 8: move up, 2: move down.  

**Objective:

The objective of this game is to hit thye ball to the other side (your opponents side) and never to miss the ball. If a player hits the ball then they get 1 point which will be displayed on the screen. If your opponents misses the ball the game is over and you win!.


**Scoring: 
If a player hits the ball they get a point which will be displayed on top of the screen.


**Customization:

You can modify the speed of the ball by changing the argument in the time.sleep() method found in the main.py file. The default speed is 0.05 you can slowly change this by 0.01...caution: decreasing this value abruptly will make the ball go too fast!. If you want to change the keyboard controls you can do this by changing the key argument to your preffered one in the screen.onkeypress() method found in the main.py file: screen.onkeypress(key = "your_keyboard_input"). You can even modify this in such a way that every time a player hits the ball the speed increases!.

**Challenges: 
This game is the best to sharpen your reflexes. if you really want to push the limits slowly increase the speed of the ball and try beating your opponent!.


**Python game: 

This game is entirely built on python. It showcases a classical game development capabilities of the python libraries such as the turtle module. This project is a perfect example of showcasing basic python coding skills to built an amazing game for fun or for educational purpose!
